####In the study last week, I got a good understanding of the basic syntax and loop syntax of python. Nowadays, python is a very popular language and used in many fields. This is why I chose this course. Since I have learned some JS, I can understand the basic syntax of Pyhon.

####And we did a few exercises using loops. At first, we couldn't adapt to this Syntax change, but after contacting, I should understand these basic syntaxes.
